Keyboard support

We already did basic keyboard functionality in the
earliest tutorials, to make the Esc key close the window,
this was done in Main.cpp

Now, we pass the array of 255 keys into Scene to 
control the camera.

Bonus challenge:
Implement mouse movement, and try to replicate
the camera system from the OpenGL tutorials
